# Vending-Machine-Demo
A demo of vending machine logic. Based on .Net Core, Vue and SignalR. UI is very limited/absent. Bootstrap CSS is used for some basics

Some notes:

All the Vue code is in site.js located in the wwwwroot/js folder.

Security for listening clients via SignalR is not implemented. 
No Database or storage used. All runs in memory. To reset to default values just hit the red button.
